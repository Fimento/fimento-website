We are very happy to be a member of the industry association Swedish Financial Technology Association, known as SweFinTech or SFTA.

SFTA works for a well-functioning FinTech market in Sweden. They initiate meetings and cooperation with relevant government officials, authorities, agencies, politicians, and other business organizations. As a member, we have access to a large industry network and have greater opportunities to influence the FinTech market here in Sweden.

Sweden has had some tremendous success in Fintech, especially in payments, but there is more to be done, not least in open banking. We will be supporting the SFTA in creating impact and strengthening the industry.

We are looking forward to sharing our knowledge and taking part in the transformation of the industry and plugging the knowledge gaps as well as finding new solutions. All this in a community where ultimately, we are creating better banking and financing services for the end client.
