**Fimento Ledger is a modern banking system, combining smart data analytics with extensive scalability.**\
Banks and financial institutes need to simplify processes and, at the same time, remain flexible. When they succeed, they can look forward to new possibilities and smarter ways of working.\
New regulations and changing customer behavior require:

* shorter time-to-market
* secure compliance
* increased flexibility

## What is Fimento Ledger?

Fimento Ledger collects large amounts of data. It structures and categorizes this data in a way that simplifies analysis and ultimately leads to a user-friendly experience.

### Efficient and cost-effective

Customizable, automated processes lead to increased profit margins. They shorten client onboarding and increase efficiency while eliminating errors.

### A new way to evaluate and onboard customers

Traditional risk assessment methods are outdated. Conventional credit-scoring doesn’t tell the whole story about a potential customer. Instead, Fimento’s evaluations of customer behavior are much more precise.\
We offer a new, smoother, way for our partners to onboard valuable new customers. We want you to be able to focus on developing the talent, creativity, and entrepreneurship in your business.

### Customizable to your needs

Fimento Ledger is flexible and easy to adapt. It doesn’t matter if you are a big bank or a small business. Depending on your needs, you may choose one or several modules – or to utilize the whole Fimento ecosystem.

### A new and collaborative way of working

We want to be the most customer-friendly company on the market. For us, it’s key to understand the needs of the day-to-day user as much as those of the in-house development team.\
We believe in creating a strong partnership with our customers. Our collective experiences and insights will lead to the progress and evolution of our products.
