Imagine the GDP of a country like France or Germany. That is how much money is getting laundered in the financial systemâ€”every year.\
Money laundering is a crime with real victims.\
If you are a bank or any financial institution and you operate within the EU, you are obliged to comply with the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive.\
You need to know:

1. Who your customers are,
2. their goals
3. and the origin of their funds.

It is a tough grind for any organization. But now Fimento is smoothening the process. Our AML functions are built-in and fully integrated with other modules, like Onboarding or Ledger.\
Fimento automatically monitors information like transactions, credit history, IP addresses, and more. Any deviation and the system creates a risk report for you to review.

1. Secure
2. Hassle-free
3. All in one system

Fimento takes AML seriously.\
The future of banking is here.
