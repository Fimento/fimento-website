On September 30th, Fimento's CEO Hanna Raftell visited Fintechpodden to talk about how companies, financial or non-financial, can gain significant benefits – such as faster time to market, less manual processes and greater customer personalization – by adding fintech services to their products and services.

> *For sure, there has been much talk about financial wellness and democratizing the industry, but little has come out of it. Allowing access for non-financial players, with their deep customer relationships and their inherent customer user-friendliness, to the area where the banks have failed will open up plenty of opportunities.*
>
> *The fintech companies might have created more user-friendly apps but many are still struggling with customer acquisition.*
>
> *Embedded finance can be the real game changer where market places for example can provide factoring solutions, where your favorite food chain can integrate with wealth management products and services.*
